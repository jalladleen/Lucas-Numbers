# Lucas-Numbers

Problem:
Write a recursive function/procedure to compute Lj with time complexity O(n) (more precisely, the time complexity should be O(nA(n)) when n is large, where A(n) is the complexity of adding Ln-1 and Ln-2). Implement your solution and print Li*20, where 0 < i < 25, as output. This program must be able to compute Ln precisely for n < 500.
